    The ‘Sports Analyze’ function in MYSQL is crucial for examining data from the provided table. It allows us to table a specific table or column from a table, as well as merge many tables into a single table. MS Excel is utilised to visualise the individual player's derived data using Tables and Charts.

     In this project, we utilize MYSQL and several queries to extract the essential data from the given data. We also utilize MS Excel to present the data in the form of tables and charts. The basic purpose of a pivot table is to compare different players from various perspectives.
    We were able to see the performance of each individual player as a result of this analysis.
